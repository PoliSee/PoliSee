"@AndrewSmithClub @marcmolinaro But this, while certainly being a symptom of the larger issue of anti-Semitism in America, is comparably more of a local issue than Charlottesville or the synagogue shooting",Jesus_Geist,2018-12-03 01:42:06,
"@AndrewSmithClub @marcmolinaro Not a New Yorker, but I do live in a major US city so I understand incompetent local politicians not addressing major issues like this so I'll take your word for it.

@Jesus_Geist @marcmolinaro Trump was hounded over Charlottesville for weeks about his response. No one hounds the mayor even though he is completely in charge of local police.  String of anti-Semitic attacks in 2017 was blamed on Trump's rhetoric but anti-Semitic attacks in NYC just falls off the radar.,AndrewSmithClub,2018-12-03 01:37:43,

@AndrewSmithClub @marcmolinaro The people who marched in Charlottesville dream about doing shit like this. It was a national news story because hundreds of Nazis and white supremacists organized a rally with a pretense of violence.

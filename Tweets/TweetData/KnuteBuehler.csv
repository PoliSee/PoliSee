@KnuteBuehler I got my daughter away from her own dad when she was 3 because I caught him before he could do things. They Refused to prosecute cuz she was 3. I renewed show cause papers that he was a danger&amp; I refused to go for child support. I would've done anything to keep him away from her.,fisherlady1960,2018-12-06 18:35:28,"Michigan, USA"

@KnuteBuehler Those people who failed to protect this child should be losing their jobs for starters. Just as those on parole boards who knowingly release dangerous people back into society to harm and kill again should be held responsible criminally and civilly.,Seifenmacher1,2018-12-06 04:25:06,

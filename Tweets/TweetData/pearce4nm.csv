@Pearce4NM What are we in New Mexico to do when the new Governor and legislature pass strict Gun Control?  Even though its against the US constitution and the state constitution theyâ€™ll do it anyway.  Could lead to a revolt!!  Your thoughts??,gary_killough,2018-12-07 16:20:51,

"@cgatchellus4 @Pearce4NM This was unnecessary. 
Mr. Pearce- equal in service to his country- was simply honoring a good man. 
Along with everything else, President Bush demonstrated genuine and gentlemanly decorum.

 Yvette Harrell doesn't get it why she wasn't elected. Her and Pearce are enemies to New Mexico's Environment.  
Here's why New Mexico's oil boom is raising a lot of questions about water

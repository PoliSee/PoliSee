@ChazNuttycombe @PADems @SenBobCasey @WolfForPA Maybe Wolf could take a page from Steve Beshear's playbook and appoint Tomlinson or Browne to some position in his administration. #papolitics,PrdNewEnglander,2018-11-28 16:18:24,"New Hampshire, USA"
@PrdNewEnglander @PADems @SenBobCasey @WolfForPA I just really wish there would be a special for one of the seats we barely missed this year instead of one up in 2020.,ChazNuttycombe,2018-11-28 16:15:43,"Richmond, VA"
@ChazNuttycombe @PADems @SenBobCasey @WolfForPA No idea. I'm not sure if it's even been scheduled yet. But it's clearly going to happen sometime next spring.,PrdNewEnglander,2018-11-28 16:11:05,"New Hampshire, USA"
@PrdNewEnglander @PADems @SenBobCasey @WolfForPA Will probably be a D flip. When‚Äôs the special?,ChazNuttycombe,2018-11-28 16:09:44,"Richmond, VA"
"There'll be a special election in PA's 37th State Senate district soon (with Guy Reschenthaler elected to Congress), and @PADems need to focus on winning it.

@WolfForPA It costs a passenger vehicle 66 bucks and a semi 376 bucks to ride the total length of the @PA_Turnpike(144 miles) and they increase tolls every year. Our snowflake Governor finally realized that it is hindering business development in Pa. #moron https://t.co/5P79c8ntXD,Yinzerburgher,2018-11-28 12:07:48,
@jjabbott My mom only won re-election by about 300 votes in an increasingly red county and the mayoral race was closer than it should have been within the city limits. @Bob_Casey @WolfForPA &amp; @JohnFetterman did the work and went to #Erie that‚Äôs the lesson no one should forget in 2020,G_Dahlkemper,2018-11-28 04:09:31,

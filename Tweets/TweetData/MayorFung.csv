@RickRick041560 @TedNesi @MayorFung Rick the state mandates revals happen every 3 years. Mayor has no control over that. The economy is better so your house is worth more. Fung lowered the tax rate from 22.94 to 20.29 to lesson the burden of the reval. Property tax did not go up. And yes I pay property tax,StevenAgnoli,2018-11-30 20:15:49,"Cranston, RI"
@StevenAgnoli @TedNesi @MayorFung The mayor has raised taxes in Cranston this year with the re-evaluation mine went up $450.   Two percent the year before plus all the times he raised them before that.   I pay taxes I know maybe u don‚Äôt understand math.

Why are you lighting the #RIStatehouse #ChristmasTree starting at 5pm today? People have to work. Why not after 7 or, better yet, on a SATURDAY, when people can attend? This makes no sense. #TypicalRhodeIsland

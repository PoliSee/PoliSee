"@Tonyhavlicek @MikeDeWine @GM There isn’t much of a market for sedans anymore, so those plants are closing. By your logic, if you want to keep those plants open, people need to stop buying SUVs and Crossovers...although, then those plants would close...🤔",rjolmstead,2018-11-28 14:00:35,
@Tonyhavlicek @MikeDeWine @GM Hmmm...but if we don’t buy “foreign” cars then those plants will close and those American workers will lose their jobs and we’ll be in the same predicament.

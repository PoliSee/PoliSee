"@WalkerStapleton With all due respect, it‚Äôs a shame then that you embraced Trump, which in MANY respects, stands in STARK contrast to the humility, modesty, intelligence, empathy, patriotism, and courage of HW.

Our Country has lost a hero and I have lost my North Star.  Some of my earliest memories include fishing with him while sharing 44 years of love and laughs. His selfless kindness towards others regardless of background or circumstance was unequaled. https://t.co/hsS38SaE0K,WalkerStapleton,2018-12-01 14:24:50,Colorado

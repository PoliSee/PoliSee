@azcapmedia @dougducey @dg4az Ducey sabotaged the personal cultivation clause in the Arizona Medical Marijuana Act. This inflated the price of illegal marijuana on the street and the crime and violence. The exact opposite of the Purpose of the Law and Will of the People. https://t.co/piwlAmGl6S,USHEMP,2018-11-29 15:40:45,Arizona Desert
@azcapmedia @dougducey @dg4az Republicans abused our citizens and used our TVs and Telephone to terrify old folks and turn off young voters. What the Ducey/McSally gang did to win in Arizona should be considered Domestic Terrorism. https://t.co/eIbjsPHXQc,USHEMP,2018-11-29 15:34:29,Arizona Desert

PoliSee is a web application that allows people to visualize the American political climate based
on Tweets about gubernatorial candidates. Twitter is a platform that people often use to voice their
political opinions, so we felt the site could accurately represent the overall consensus of the general

PoliSee gives people a simple but detailed way of understanding the United States' ever-changing political
atmosphere.
